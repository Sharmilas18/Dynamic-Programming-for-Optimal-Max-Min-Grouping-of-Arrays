# Dynamic-Programming-for-Optimal-Max-Min-Grouping-of-Arrays

Project Description: 
Given an input array 𝐴[1, … , 𝑁]. A grouping of the array 𝐴 is described by an array 𝐺[1, … , 𝑀], where the array 𝐴 is partitioned into 𝑀 groups, the 1st group consists of the first 𝐺[1] elements of array 𝐴, the 2nd group consists of the next 𝐺[2] elements, and so forth. Define array 𝐵[1, … , 𝑀] such that 𝐵[𝑗] is the summation of the elements in the 𝑗-th group of array 𝐴. Use a dynamic programming algorithm to find a grouping of array 𝐴 with 𝑀 groups such that we maximize the minimum element of array 𝐵.
